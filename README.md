# Wine Rating Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes wine ratings from the Piedmont region of Italy, exploring the relationship between wine price and score. Linear regression models were developed to predict wine scores based on price. This project was completed as part of the coursework for the "Statistics for Data Science" course during my Masters in Information Systems degree in 2023.

## Data Description

## Technologies Used

*   **R:** For data analysis and modeling.
*   **ggplot2:** For data visualization.
*   **RStudio:** For development.

## Code

The R script (`Wine_Ratings.R`) contains the data analysis and modeling code.
